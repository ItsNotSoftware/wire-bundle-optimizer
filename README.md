# wire-bundle-optimizer
A Python-based optimization tool to efficiently pack circular wires into the smallest possible circular bundle. This project applies constrained nonlinear optimization using SciPy's SLSQP algorithm to find the most compact, non-overlapping arrangement of wires with varying radii.
